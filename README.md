# scl
Straight-forward changelog is a tool for calculating versions and changelogs using GitHub releases and conventional commits.


## Intention

The intention of SCL is to provide a building block on top of which which release workflows can built. It will calculate the would-be version increment and changelog from any given release to any given commit in any given GitHub repository and output them to STDOUT.
